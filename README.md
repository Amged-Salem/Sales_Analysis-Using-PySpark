## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib)

### Initial Setup

1. **Initialize Spark Session**: Begin by creating a Spark session to enable data processing.
2. **Load Data**: Load sales data from a CSV file using the defined schema.

## Data Sources

- Description of the dataset used (e.g., location, source).

## Data Analysis

This project encompasses various analyses performed on the sales data, including:

- Total amount spent by order source.
- Total amount spent by each food category.
- Total amount spent by order month.
- Total amount spent by order year.
- Total amount spent by order quarter.
- How many times each product was purchased.
- Top 5 order times.
- Frequency of customer visits to restaurants.
- Total sales by each country.
- Total sales by order source.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the findings:

- A **bar chart** showcasing the total amount spent by country.
- A **pie chart** illustrating the distribution of total amounts spent by different order sources.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including PySpark and Matplotlib.

## Usage

Execute the provided analysis scripts in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm) to perform the analyses and visualize the results.
