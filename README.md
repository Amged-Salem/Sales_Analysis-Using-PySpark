# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to derive insights about spending patterns using PySpark. The analysis examines various factors such as total spending by country, order source, and customer behavior.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib)

### Initial Setup

1. **Initialize Spark Session**: Begin by creating a Spark session to enable data processing.
2. **Load Data**: Load sales data from a CSV file using the defined schema.


## Data Analysis

This project encompasses various analyses performed on the sales data, including:

- Total amount spent by order source.
- Total Amount spent by each Food Category
- Total_amount spent by ordermonth
- Total_amount spent by order_year
- Total amount spent By order quarter
- How many times each product purchased
- Top 5 order Times
- Frequecy of Customer visited to restaurent
- Total Sales by each Country
-  Total Sales By order_Source


## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the findings:

- A **bar chart** showcasing the total amount spent by country.
- A **pie chart** illustrating the distribution of total amounts spent by different order sources.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including PySpark and Matplotlib.

## Usage

Execute the provided analysis scripts in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm) to perform the analyses and visualize the results.
